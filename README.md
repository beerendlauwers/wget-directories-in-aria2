# wget-directories-in-aria2
A preprocessing script for recreating the directory structure like wget does it, but while downloading the files with aria2.

Use in combination with a script that dumps all the URLs of a site to file, like [theripper.sh](https://github.com/kajeagentspi/Datahoarder).

Refer to http://beerendlauwers.be/posts/2018-09-01-emulating-wget-directory-structure.html to see how it got cobbled together and how you can automatically start and stop the aria2 downloads during certain times of the day.
